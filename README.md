# WordSearchPuzzel-using-Cpp
This is a programming fundamental project.

This is one of my finest work with functional C++ programming and if you are a kid trying to cheat then mark my words you are never going to understand what is
happening inside the Source.cpp file and it is useless to explain this code to someone else.

If you want to review some hardcore C++ programming then you can have a look at the source.cpp file.

## functionality
The board.txt contains 15x15 matrix which is used as a board for this game but you can use any dimension like MxM (M=15).
Highsocre.txt save the high score secured by any player that played the game and it also save the state of previous games.
pausedgame.txt saves the current state of the game where the user can save the game and can also play next time.
dictionary.txt is an english dictionary txt file that contains all the valid english words that are used to validate the words.
Source.cpp contains a marvelous piece of C++ coding that is written by me.

## Run
You can run this on powershell or cmd 
```sh
g++ Source.cpp -o a.exe
```
```sh
a.exe
```
